									<h3>Python/C#</h3>
									<p>In terms of programming, I have taken C# courses online through YouTube as an exploration of game development as a career path, as well as python from high school. While I gained a solid foundation programming, I never went beyond and created anything complex nor ambitious leading to a low skill level.</p>
									<h3>Japanese Language</h3>
									<p>Due to how the writing system for is structed in Japanese in learning symbols (kanji) rather than alphabets, I was compelled to learning it on a routine basis and later acquired the mindset of learning continuously which led me to achieving highest mark in Japanese class, as well as maintaining a proficiency level of advanced (N2). </p>
									<h3>Communications</h3>
									<p>I am lacking in all aspects of verbal communications. One reason could be being accustomed to growing up in places with different languages that I didnâ€™t understand well which lead to less communication. I have trouble being clear and expressing myself where I cannot do well unless I planned what I want to talk about beforehand. While I have started living without parents since last year which forced me to communicatee with others to get around life and joining a variety of societies and activities, I am not yet confident. In technical terms, this would impact in businesses were clear communication, dealing with conflicts, negotiation etc. is necessary.</p>
